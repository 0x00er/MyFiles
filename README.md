How to install My Files - file manager on Android devices
Android devices have the ability to "sideload" applications. Here's how you can do it.

<h3>Step 1: Setting up your device</h3>

From your smartphone or tablet running Android 4.0 or higher, go to Settings, scroll down to Security, and select Unknown sources. Selecting this option will allow you to install apps outside of the Google Play store. Depending on your device, you can also choose to be warned before installing harmful apps. This can be enabled by selecting the Verify apps option in the Security settings.

On devices running an earlier version of Android, go to Settings, open the Applications option, select Unknown sources, and click OK on the popup alert.

<h3>Step 2: Downloading My Files apk</h3>

The next step will be downloading My Files - file manager installer file, also known as an APK, which is the way Android apps are distributed and installed. My Files - file manager apk downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/SnowflAI) is 100% safe and virus free, no extra costs.

<h3>Step 3: The process</h3>

You can either download the APK file on your mobile device or on your computer, although the latter is a little more difficult. To get started, download an APK file using either Google Chrome or the stock Android browser. Next, go to your app drawer and click Downloads; here you will find the file you just downloaded. Open the file and install the app.

If you downloaded the APK file on your computer, the process is slightly different. You must connect your Android device to the PC and enable USB mass-storage mode. The next step is to drag and drop the file onto your device. Then, using a file manager, such as Astro or ES File Explorer, you can locate the file on your device and install it.

How to install My Files on your computer (Windows PC, Mac, ...)
You can run Android apps on your computer using an Android emulator app. There're many Android emulators but in this tutorial we use [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com). It's available for both Mac and Windows.

<h4>Step 1: Setup</h4>

Installing BlueStacks is a very simple process. All you have to do is download the program from the BlueStacks website and run the file. The installer file is quite large and the engine setup may take awhile.

Once the initial installation process is done, opening the program doesn’t take more than a few seconds. when it opens, you will be asked to sign in using a Google account like any Android smartphone/tablet.

During the installation process, you may come across error messages like “Hardware acceleration is not available on your system” or “This host supports Intel VT-x, but it is disabled.” Enabling hardware acceleration features help virtualization apps run smoother and much faster — apps like Bluestacks are basically running an entire OS on top of your current system.

<h4>Step 2: Installing My Files APK</h4>

If you haven't installed any other programs that associate with the APK file type, BlueStacks will automatically open APK files. Double-click the file to launch BlueStacks and install the app. You can also drag-and-drop the APK file onto the BlueStacks home screen. Confirm that you want to install the app, and it will appear on your BlueStacks home screen after installing.

That's it! Now you have successfully installed My Files on your computer using Bluestacks.
